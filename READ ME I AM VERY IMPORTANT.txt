INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

This mod requires the Steam version of Sonic Mania. This mod is not designed for the Origin version of the game.
The Plus DLC is *not* required to play this mod.

You need to have the Mania Mod Loader installed to use this mod. Download it here:

To install the mod, simply drop the "Sonic Mania: The Misfits Pack" folder into the mods
folder. Next, open the mod loader and check the mod in the list to enable it.

This mod utilizes some cheat codes to enable certain functions:
	- "Remove Zone Locks"
	- "Force Disable Plus Logo"
	- "Disable Bonus Warps From Checkpoints"
All of these should be enabled by default, but it's still a good idea to double-check. Go to the "Codes" tab, and if for some reason these aren't already enabled, enable them. From there, hit "Save & Play" and enjoy!
 
If a cutscene hangs, just press Enter and it will skip.
